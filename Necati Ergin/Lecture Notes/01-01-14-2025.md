## General topic is about C core in C++ and differences between C. 
```cpp
//C++17
if (int x = foo(); x > 10) { 

}
```

- zero-cost abstraction: What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.
- chrono millisecond to double conversion
- implicit type conversion in c 

```cpp
// in c 
#include <stdio.h>
// in cpp there is no .h and c key at the start.
#include <cstdio>
```

- implicit int rule `int a {0};` removed in c99 but because of the backwards compatibility .c files still supports it, but in cpp this is invalid.
- difference example.
```cpp
void foo();
void bar(void);
int main() {
	foo(1,2,3) // valid in c but not in cpp 
}
```

- in c `char` is actually `int` but in cpp `char` is `char` for example 'A'. 
- in c `10 > 5` is `int 1` but in cpp it is `bool true` because there is no bool in c. 
- `auto a = true + true;` a int = 2; inteller promotion. implicit converion from bool to int. 
- `char* p = reinterpret_cast<char*> (&x); // cpp version`
`char* p = (char *) &x; // c version `

#### Rank System  
**floating-point types**
- long double lowest rank of the three
- double 
- float
**integral types**
- bool has the lowest rank
- char signed/unsigned variants come next 
- short signed/unsigned variants come next 
- int
- long 
- long long 

floating-point: _float_ < _double_ < _long double_
integral: _bool_ < _char_ < _short_ < _int_ < _long_ < _long long_
